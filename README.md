# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Caution: this description gets META! I created this prework study guide webpage using the prework study guide provided using the prework study guide materials given to me by the boot camp program. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript that detail some quick points and somewhat random tips that can help someone refresh their memory (assuming the issue is answered in these notes).



## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each section of the guide containts one of four topics related to languages that were used to create this guide (getting meta again...). Also if you open the DevTools console, you can see the Javascript running, listing the topics learned (and listed) and randomly selecting which one to study first.
